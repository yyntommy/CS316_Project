Very laid back and easy going couple, know to actually do adult things without having to be asked. We both smoke cigarettes, but dont mind to keep it outside only. We do both have a son each from a previous relationship, but since school is back in they wont be around much if at all. One is 16 and works while attending high school and the other is 11 and doesnt live close enough to visit during school year. We have a female cat who is almost 2 years old, that (Wife) does treat like her child. She has 5 kittens with her who are almost weaned already, and are already litter box trained (which wife keeps very very clean) and the cat is use to staying in our bedroom with no problem. She will be fixed as soon as possible after her babies are gone. Our current/bout to be former roommates had been collecting our half of the rent to pay in with theirs...had taken it upon themselves to decide to just take our money and not pay rent at all. We got surprised by that information today Aug 31st when the landlord came to collect all the rent past due...when we couldnt produce the money due to already paying out our portion and now being expected to cover theirs as well...we were informed we all had to be out in two weeks at the most. So now we are scrambling trying to find an animal friendly environment to help us get back on our feet, wether the arrangements be temporary, or something we all decided to continue and make a home.  We are a cannabis friendly couple, despite the fact (husband) doesnt smoke (wife definitely does) but again, same as cigarettes, if its something you dont do...it will stay outdoors and not in your face outta respect. We dont judge any lifestyle ways you happen to be part of...we dont mind same sex couples or anything along that nature. Everyone deserves to be happy with who they are and who they are with...without persecution or ridicule from anyone they cross paths with in life. Hopefully this unfortunate series of events thats led to this post by me, will turn out beneficial to every party involved. Please feel free to ask absolutely any further questions that havent been touched on.
Thanks so Much for taking the time to consider helping someone out in desperate need...we hope to be able to return the favor your way.
💜Dave & Heather Ogle💜');
