Ashley Murray - 

Milestone 1: wrote the python code to generate sample dataset, which was built upon by other members. Helped create load.sql.

Milestone 2: built upon the html framework to add more design elements.  Created icons in Photoshop for added user experience. 

Worked with fixing all the elements using CSS, helped by Brandon Xie and Brandon Zhao. Created the overall design for a better UX/UI. 

Webscrapped a website that helps people find roommates for the sample dataset in the Blog_Post table. Created the second load.sql in order to load in these blog posts into the database. Worked on the final presentation, and fixing other bugs found in the site for the demo.

Milestone 1: Made the create.sql and load.sql files.

Milestone 2: Designed, coded, and integrated the matching algorithm. Configured and integrated the Postgresql database--involved redesigning and implementing new models.py, load.sql, create.sql and providing instructions on how to make local copy. Created preliminary large-scale database generator. Wrote up new ER diagram and relevant tables.

Final Demo: Did some debugging--mainly revised the way the algorithm carries out matching after a couple of input assumptions were changed. Also added additional info to a couple slides.
